# armstrong

## Principles
Principles:
- emphasizing commitment - we're doing progressive work that is building towards a thing
- this is armstrong time - no outside projects / not being present to our work
- we're a team; researching and working together to learn this cool technology
- building community and network - alumni and Denver community engagement
- we demarcate our BS line

#curricular ideas / goals
1. First spike: watch an intro video, define the blockchain, talk about what we know and what questions we have
2. Study alumni repos and code examples / set up our environment / write a contract in the online browser: 
  * Alumni repos: what's going on here? annotate it, study a test, play around with changing the code to write your own contract
  * Set up the environment
  * Write a contract
3. Application design - Mike Schutte will talk to us about how they thought about this
