# armstrong

## Principles
Principles:
- emphasizing commitment - we're doing progressive work that is building towards a thing
- this is armstrong time - no outside projects / not being present to our work
- we're a team; researching and working together to learn this cool technology
- building community and network - alumni and Denver community engagement

#curricular ideas / goals
1. First spike: watch an intro video, explain why solidity is so cool, and set up our environment // look at a contract in the online web browser
2. Study Ethan / Nick repos and code examples - what's going on here? annotate it, study a test, play around with changing the code to write your own contract
3. Write a contract
4. Application design around block chain technology - studying their repos and maybe as Schutte to explain how they thought about it
