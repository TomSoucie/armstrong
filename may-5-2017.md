# Why Blockchain Will Change the World (Or Won't)
### Description
There's a lot of hype going around about blockchain, with everyone from Fortune 100 companies to anarchists proclaiming the revolutionary power. From cryptocurrencies to uncorruptable voting systems, blockchain is going to solve all our problems, right?

Right. But what is the blockchain? In this first meeting of Armstrong we'll look at all the revolutionary potential. And we'll cut through the hype and give a simple definition anyone can take to a happy hour.

Join us to brainstorm what we want to accomplish as a research team this module; the questions we want to explore and what we'd like to build. All are welcome!
